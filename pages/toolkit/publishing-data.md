_This guide will be likely be most useful to IT managers, GIS coordinators, asset managers and database administrators._

This guide is aimed at general, easily uploadable datasets such as PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets and so on. Larger, more complex datasets, eg; geospatial will likely be unable to utilise [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz) and may prefer to look into their own hosting solutions.

The general process for uploading a dataset is as follows:

1. Identify datasets to publish
2. For each dataset:
  1. Identify a standard to follow, if possible
  2. Export the data, conforming to the set standard
  3. Upload the dataset to data.govt.nz, providing metadata and choosing an appropriate license
3. Schedule regular updates

## 1.0 Identify datasets to publish

For the first dataset, it's recommended that you pick something that is likely to be useful straight away. It should also be known to be of good quality as well as being free from any privacy or confidentiality issues.

Some examples of good starting datasets that don't change frequently would be **drain pipes, waste collection zones, dog walking zones, and customer service center locations**.

## 2.1 Identify an open data standard

## 2.2 Preparing the datasets

## 3.3 Creating the datasets

From the front page of the [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz) website, you'll be able to see an **Add Data** button in the top right corner followed by **Submit Dataset** on the next page.

Your submission to data.govt.nz will a few pieces of information:

  - Dataset title
  - A direct link to the dataset
  - A description of the dataset
  - The category it fits under
  - The formats it is available is
  - Re-use rights / license (**See below**)
  - Update frequency (daily, monthly, yearly?)
  - Title of the agency responsible for the dataset
  - A contact email address (which will **NOT** be published)

#### Deciding on a license

Licensing is easily the most important aspect of releasing your dataset. It will determine whether or not your dataset can be used for a commercial purpose, publically redistributed and/or whether or not others have to provide attribution for your work.
