_This guide will be likely be most useful to IT managers, GIS coordinators, asset managers and database administrators._

This guide is aimed at general, easily uploadable datasets such as PDFs, CSVs, spreadsheets and so on. Larger, more complex datasets, eg; geospatial will likely be unable to utilise [data.govt.nz](https://data.govt.nz) and may prefer to look into their own hosting solutions.

The general process for uploading a dataset is as follows:

1. Identify datasets to publish
2. For each dataset:
  1. Identify a standard to follow, if possible
  2. Export the data, conforming to the set standard
  3. Upload the dataset to data.govt.nz, providing metadata and choosing an appropriate license
3. Schedule regular updates

## 1.0 Identify datasets to publish

For the first dataset, it's recommended that you pick something that is likely to be useful straight away. It should also be known to be of good quality as well as being free from any privacy or confidentiality issues.

Some examples of good starting datasets that don't change frequently would be **drain pipes, waste collection zones, dog walking zones, and customer service center locations**.

## 2.1 Identify an open data standard

## 2.2 Preparing the datasets

## 3.3 Creating the datasets
