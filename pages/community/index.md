### Open Data Networks within New Zealand

- **[R9 Accelerator](http://www.r9accelerator.co.nz/)** was formed as testing ground for innovative solutions to everyday issues within government. Creatives from both the public and private space have three months in which they conduct a deep dive into areas of opportunity. During that time, they come to understand the issues that government is facing and invent solutions to help better aid their customers
- **[Code for Aoteraoa](http://codeforaotearoa.org)** is New Zealand's own version of the global [Code for All](https://codeforall.org/) initiative which is currently undoing a pilot program with a four civic tech fellows, Two are housed in the [Wellington City Council](http://wellington.govt.nz/) with another two aiding [LINZ](http://linz.govt.nz) and they both work to build tools and resources  to aid their respective agencies in their Open Data journeys.
