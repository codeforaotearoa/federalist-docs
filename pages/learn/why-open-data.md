Better title: Examples of Open Data usage?

So, you think Open Data sounds like a really swell proposition but you're still itching to know what it can help accomplish? Surely people aren't interesting X dataset are they?

Let us introduce you to a few Open Data oddities that have popped up over the past few years. They may seem peculiar but there's no doubt that they've definitely challenged the assumptions about how useful any given data set may be!

### [Adopt A Hydrant](http://www.adoptahydrant.org/)

Adopt a what? Yup, you heard me right. The precise location of fire hydrants in Boston City may put you to sleep at first but what if someone took it and made something, not only enjoyable but also beneficial to the city?

A typical snow storm in Boston can blanket the city for days, forcing residents to shovel their driveways but other utilities can remain lost for days. In a life or death situation like a burning build, a firefighter may not have time to dig out a hydrant, let alone spend the time necessarily to locate it under such heavy snowfall.

This was exactly the type of problem solved by [Adopt A Hydrant](http://www.adoptahydrant.org/) using Open Data. Citizens of Boston could 'adopt' a hydrant of their own which they kept clean and shovelled. If they didn't keep up their responsibilities in a timely manner, neighbours would have the opportunity to "steal" their hydrant away from them!

You can read more about the story [here](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/adopt-a-hydrant-snowstorms/19897879) but it's a good example of how you can "gamify" data and get citizens engaged in city affairs in a way that they otherwise wouldn't have.

Best of all, it's [open source](https://github.com/codeforamerica/adopt-a-hydrant) as well which means anyone can take the application and with a bit of retooling, adapt it to fit their city too. There have been a few interesting spin offs already like [Adopt A Siren](http://sirens.honolulu.gov/) in Honolulu.

### [Email A Tree](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398210/)

What do you do if you're a city that has an ever expanding amount of trees but not enough resources to monitor them all? Give them email addresses!

Well, I'm sure there are other alternatives but this crafty application of data and technology produced a website that let Melbourne citizens email specific trees to report issues like broken branches or fallen leaves.

It worked!

Funnily enough, citizens also started expressing their affection for their favourite trees as well, writing in to say how much they
