So, you think Open Data sounds like a really swell proposition but you're still itching to know what it can help accomplish? Surely people aren't interesting X dataset are they?

Let us introduce you to a few Open Data oddities that have popped up over the past few years. They may seem peculiar but there's no doubt that they've definitely challenged the assumptions about how useful any given data set may be!

### [Adopt A Hydrant](http://www.adoptahydrant.org/)

Adopt a what? Yup, you heard me right. The precise location of fire hydrants in Boston City may put you to sleep at first but what if someone took it and made something, not only enjoyable but also beneficial to the city?

A typical snow storm in Boston can blanket the city for days, forcing residents to shovel their driveways but other utilities can remain lost for days. In a life or death situation like a burning build, a firefighter may not have time to dig out a hydrant, let alone spend the time necessarily to locate it under such heavy snowfall.

This was exactly the type of problem solved by [Adopt A Hydrant](http://www.adoptahydrant.org/) using Open Data.
