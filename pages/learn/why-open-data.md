Doing Open data is not easy, requires time and resources, and also a challenge to make sure one doesn't cross the fine line between transparency and privacy.
So if it is so challenging and requires money, then the question is : Is it worth it?

Watch this video by Open Data NZ team and listen to the team talk about its potentials...

This is just the tip of the iceberg, there is much more to this. Imagine how much more potential it has when we start talking about collaboration between different agencies and governements. 

Some of the key areas where Open Government Data is creating value are: 

- Transparency and democratic control
- Participation
- Self-empowerment
- Improved or new private products and services
- Innovation
- Improved efficiency of government services
- Improved effectiveness of government services
- Impact measurement of policies
- New knowledge from combined data sources and patterns in large data volumes

A few examples that validate the above:

- The ['tax tree'] and ['where does my money go'](http://app.wheredoesmymoneygo.org//) are projects that show how tax money is being spent by government. 
- And there’s the example of [how open data saved Canada $3.2 billion in charity tax fraud](https://eaves.ca/2010/04/14/case-study-open-data-and-the-public-purse/). 
- Also various websites such as the Danish [folketsting.dk](folketsting.dk) track activity in parliament and the law making processes, so you can see what exactly is happening, and which parliamentarians are involved.
- It also helps in making more informed personal life decisions, A woman in Denmark built website, which showed all the [Danish public toilets](http://beta.findtoilet.dk/), so that people she knew with bladder problems can now trust themselves to go out more again.

In summary, key benefits of open data include:

- Promoting greater transparency and engagement between government and community-members by allowing scope for data to be analysed and visualised in unique and different ways (where government may not always have the expertise or resources to do so). This can lead to a more engaged, connected and informed community and can help highlight some of the work councils are doing behind the scenes to collect and manage public data.
- Facilitating social and commercial innovation, by allowing the growth of new business and service models that rely on open data.
- Improving service delivery and community satisfaction by allowing citizens to interact with public government data via online interfaces or community-developed apps.

In the computer world there is something called Linus’ Law, which states: “given enough eyeballs, all bugs (problems) are shallow.” and one can draw parallels from it for almost everything. 
There can also be long-term or unforeseen benefits in opening data. This is because it is not always possible to predict the kinds of innovation that may evolve in response to the release of open data.
